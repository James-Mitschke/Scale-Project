# Scale-Project
A Unity engine C# game created following the theme of "Scale" from the Gameoff Gamejam 2023. The project is built using Unity version 2021.3.24f1. This project aims to be a minigame that uses procedurally generated obstacles and powerups with the objective of getting a highscore on a local leaderboard, and will contain some different endings based upon what causes the player to finish the current game.

# Setup
Open the project within the Unity engine, use the Unity version the project was built in for compatability and to avoid deprecated code.
